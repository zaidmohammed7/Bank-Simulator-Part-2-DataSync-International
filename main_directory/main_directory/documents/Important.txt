Important!
Please read the following before running the program.

The DataSync® International source code involves a variety of .ico and .png images that ensure a smooth user experience
and a user-friendly interface. However, while running the program on other systems, certain errors can occur, and the
interface might not be similar to what is expected. To ensure such errors are not encountered, please open any Graphical
User Interface (GUI) source code file and create the folders according to the one embedded in the source location folder.

Hope you are having a great time with DataSync® International.
